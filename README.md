Introduction
As a web developer, I'm constantly exploring new ways to blend creativity with technical skills. This portfolio repository represents my journey of creating cool and engaging websites that serve as both a showcase of my abilities and a source of inspiration for others.

Technologies
The projects in this repository are primarily built using the following technologies:

Vanilla JavaScript: For some of the projects, I leveraged the power of pure JavaScript to build interactive elements and animations, creating smooth user experiences.

React: React allowed me to build dynamic and modular user interfaces, enabling seamless navigation and efficient component management.

HTML & CSS: The foundation of every web project, I used HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring that each website is visually appealing and responsive.

Additional Libraries: In certain projects, I integrated various libraries to enhance functionality and visual effects.
